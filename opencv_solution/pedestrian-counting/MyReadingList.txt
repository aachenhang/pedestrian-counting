Crowd Counting Estimation in Video Surveillance Based on Linear Regression Function 
KeyPoints:
	Existing alogotithms can be divided into quantitative statistics methods and qualitative estimation methods.
	Pixel-based method faces the difficulty of foreground extraction and perspectrive distortion.
	Light Effect Suppression Model(LESM) is used to extract the foreground, which combines MLBS and MFDM.
	Oriented Inner Edges(OIEs) is applied to indicate the occlusion area.
	A new method of perspective normalization is applied to furthest reduce the impact of perspective distortion.
